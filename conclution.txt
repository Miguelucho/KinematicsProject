Conclution
Add the matrices of each link that I needed. 
And I studied the part of the code of the IK 
and I could not solve the problem but if you 
tell me that the arm if you take the can in 
the image Prub.png the can that is standing 
on the floor was taken by the arm. Conclution, 
I think the error I have is because of my 
personal computer that does not have the 
resources to support this simulation. In the 
folder misc_images the image Prub2.png shows 
errors obtained during the simulation.
